The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project is meant to showcase my javascript skills to create
a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. For this initial game, it will make use of the console and prompts instead of using UI. The game begins when you press the start button, which will last 5 rounds. After the game is over, the user can choose to replay the game, and choose how many rounds they would like to play. I used loops, window.onload, and various created functions.
