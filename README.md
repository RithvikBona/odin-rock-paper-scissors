The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Project

Website: https://rithvikbona.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/

This project is meant to showcase my javascript skills to create a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Logic includes loops, window.onload, and various created functions. The user can pick their input and the first to 5 wins the game. Initially, the game ran on the console, but I learned to use feature branches to create a UI branch to create a visually appealing game with responsive buttons using :hover, and then merged to main.
